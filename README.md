Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Artemis financial is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for its customers.  Their primary concern was ensuring the security and reliability of their software systems, as these systems handle critical and confidential information. The company tasked me with identifying weaknesses in their existing codebase and addressing these vulnerabilities by applying secure coding practices. The ultimate goal was to enhance the software's defenses against potential threats and ensure the protection of their clients' sensitive financial information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

I carefully reviewed the code and found important security issues, like weak password protection and unsafe communication. I fixed these problems to make the software more secure. Coding securely is important because it protects sensitive information, keeps customers’ trust, and prevents expensive security problems. A secure system helps the company stay successful and reliable.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The dependency check tool was particularly helpful during the assessment. It allowed me to quickly identify outdated or vulnerable libraries in the codebase, which could pose significant security risks. This streamlined the process of pinpointing specific areas that required updates or remediation, making it easier to address potential issues effectively.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

I made the system more secure by adding SSL encryption to protect data and SHA-256 hashing to keep information safe. In the future, I would use tools like security scanners and follow guidelines like the OWASP Top Ten to find and fix problems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

I tested the application after each update to ensure functionality and used automated scanning tools to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced. Manual reviews further ensured the security and reliability of the changes.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

I utilized secure coding practices like encryption, hashing, and proper configuration of application properties. Automated tools, such as static analyzers, and adhering to established security standards will be important in future assignments to build robust, secure systems.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

I would highlight my ability to identify and address software vulnerabilities while maintaining functionality. Implementing SSL encryption, SHA-256 hashing, and conducting rigorous testing demonstrate my commitment to building secure, efficient applications that meet industry standards.
